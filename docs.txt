BTPY DOCUMENTATION
==================

/share/torrents/bin/cleartorrents

Cleartorrents will, as the name implies, clear torrents from your 
~/torrents.list file.  /share/torrents/bin/stop appends to ~/torrents.list,
and cleartorrents removes from torrents.list.  It is important that you call
cleartorrents after downloading files, as this marks them for expiration by
moving them to the 'expired' directory, /share/expired.  Cleartorrents will
maintain a file in your home directory called '.fetched_files'.  You can use
this file and ~/torrents.list to automate downloads to your local machine.

USAGE: 
cleartorrents <file1> ... <fileN>
cleartorrents

========================================================================

/share/torrents/bin/findexpired

Findexpired will expire (permanently remove) old, expired torrents that nobody
wants.  It is a cronned script that only root can run.

========================================================================

/share/torrents/bin/printlink

Printlink will let you download a torrent that, while completed, you still
want to seed.  Printlink will make hardlinks to the files in the torrent and
emit a path that you can use to download those files from.  This path will
be '/share/torrents/<YOUR_UID>/<filez>'.  It is important that you call
'cleartorrents' after downloading these files.

USAGE: 
printlink <file1>.torrent ... <fileN>.torrent

========================================================================
/share/torrents/bin/showdownloads

Showdownloads simply shows what's being downloaded and the filesize.

USAGE: 
showdownloads

========================================================================
/share/torrents/bin/start

Start will, as its name implies, start downloading a torrent.  You can
specify a URL to fetch, a cookies file to use for authentication
(defaults to ~/.btrss/cookies.txt), and whether or not to force the 
download.  Start consults a list of all the torrents that have been 
downloaded.  For older torrents that have been expired, it may be necessary
to force the download.  You can do this by passing off the "-f" option to
start.

USAGE:
start [--force] [-f] [--cookies=<PATH>] <file/url1> ... <file/urlN>

========================================================================
/share/torrents/bin/stop

Stop will stop a torrent, moving the contents from the incoming directory
to wherever you happen to be residing at the time.  It will also append to
your ~/torrents.list file for automation purposes.  Stop also appends to a
list of all the torrents downloaded so users don't download the same torrent
twice.  Stop can optionally pause a torrent by passing off the "-p" flag.
Pausing a torrent will keep the contents in the incoming directory but stop
seeding, useful if the original seed disappears and you find yourself 
uploading gigs and gigs while not receiving anything in return.  Stop can also
flat out delete a torrent and its contents by passing off the "-d" flag, 
useful if the original seeder goes away permanently or the torrent is 
removed.

USAGE: 
stop [--delete] [-d] [--pause] [-p] <file1> ... <fileN>
